# RaBe Airtime Fork

***Breaking news:*** We have forked AirTime to [LibreTime](https://github.com/LibreTime/libretime). 
This repo will stay in use until we have switched our local install to
the new fork after pushing and/or finalizing the feature branches here.

Welcome to the RaBe Airtime fork. This fork contains fixes to get Airtime
up and running for use at [Radio Bern RaBe](http://rabe.ch) on CentOS 7.

It aims at being organized in a fashion so that the changes done to Airtime
are kept as atomic as possible while still offering a way to build and 
deploy proper, working RPMs.

We provide prebuilt binary packages part of the [home:radiorabe:airtime project](https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/home:radiorabe:airtime)
on the [openSUSE Build Service](https://build.opensuse.org/).

The original Airtime README file is available at [README](README).

## Main Features

* Make Airtime work out of the box on CentOS 7.3 and up
* Add missing integration points for the needs of a local community radio station
* Namely these focus on
  * Integration with studio playout equipment
  * Sending streams to an FM transmitter site and multiple DAB+ sites
  * Integration with other systems like Calendaring for a program grid

## Quickstart

The following instructions show how to get up and running quickly. To
deploy these packages on production you will have to review the default
policies of the packages and adapt them to your organizations policies.

### Install repositories

```bash
# install dependencies
yum install epel-release centos-release-scl

yum install http://li.nux.ro/download/nux/dextop/el7/x86_64/nux-dextop-release-0-5.el7.nux.noarch.rpm

curl -o /etc/yum.repos.d/home:radiorabe:liquidsoap.repo \
     http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/radiorabe:/liquidsoap/CentOS_7/home:radiorabe:liquidsoap.repo

# install airtime repo
curl -o /etc/yum.repos.d/home:radiorabe:airtime.repo \
     http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/radiorabe:/airtime/CentOS_7/home:radiorabe:airtime.repo
```

You need to make sure that you are installing the updated versions of 
python-kombu and python-amqp from the airtime repo and not their epel 
equivalents that have stopped working against current versions of 
rabbitmq.

## Repo Organization

Since we want to be able to contribute our changes back this repo is organized
in a bunch of branches. New features get integrated onto their proper
`feature/` branch before being integrated with our main branch `rabe`.

We keep the features branches for reference and any fixes to given feature
are landed via those branches. This enables us to rebase feature branches
onto upstream and other interested parties to integrate our work into their
own fork with ease.

We are aware that the contents herein are structured in a rather difficult
to manage fashion using lots of branches. Please do not hesitate to create
an issue or contact @hairmare if you need help with merging and/or rebasing.

We are actively seeking a community managed upstream. Please open an
issue with a proposal if you feel that you are the right fit for us.

To help you get an overview the branches are listed below.

## Branch Overview

* [main `rabe` branch](https://github.com/radiorabe/airtime/tree/rabe) (you are here)

### Feature Branches

* [tls-support](https://github.com/radiorabe/airtime/tree/feature/tls-support) ([LibreTime/libretime#98](https://github.com/LibreTime/libretime/pull/98))

  TLS support for secure access to airtime-web in the python api client and in
  API responses used by silan.

* [fix-media-monitor](https://github.com/radiorabe/airtime/tree/feature/fix-media-monitor) (no plans to pr)

  Lots of small fixes vor various bugs that should have been fixed in upstream ages ago.
  Mostly small stuff like wrong syntax in 2.5.x and changes to opinionated decisions
  by upstream that do not fly at rabe.

* [remove-pref-cache](https://github.com/radiorabe/airtime/tree/feature/remove-pref-cache) ([LibreTime/libretime#45](https://github.com/LibreTime/libretime/pull/45))

  The cache was badly broken at some stage and most likely never had any significant
  impact on performance.

* [python-install](https://github.com/radiorabe/airtime/tree/feature/python-install) (fixed by saas-dev)

  We remove most of the install routine not strictly doing pythony stuff. This makes
  the project more portable while shifting the onerous task of maintaining distro
  specifics closer to the distro maintainers. We do this because we support
  CentOS and do not need any upstart files or whatnot.

* [ipa-support](https://github.com/radiorabe/airtime/tree/feature/ipa-support) ([LibreTime/libretime#136](https://github.com/LibreTime/libretime/pull/136))

  Hacky patchset to switch the auth layer over to a freeIPA instance via some
  apache config. Highly experimental.

* [logging](https://github.com/radiorabe/airtime/tree/feature/logging)

  Fixes and changes to logging. Highly experimental.

* [playlist-api](https://github.com/radiorabe/airtime/tree/feature/playlist-api)

  Simple playlist API that allows other consumers to access complete listings of
  playlists created in airtime. Experimental.

* [systemd-files](https://github.com/radiorabe/airtime/tree/feature/systemd-files) ([LibreTime/libretime#64](https://github.com/LibreTime/libretime/pull/64) among others)

  SystemD units for running airtime components. All files are under `contrib/systemd`
  where packagers may or may not choose to install them from.

* [rpm-specfile](https://github.com/radiorabe/airtime/tree/feature/rpm-specfile)

  Contains airtime.spec used to build packages on openSUSE Build Service.

* [fork-info](https://github.com/radiorabe/airtime/tree/feature/fork-info) ([sourcefabric/airtime#136](https://github.com/sourcefabric/airtime/pull/136))

  Output fork information on /dashboard/about with minimal changes to upstream. See [README.forking.md](docs/README.forking.md) for more information.

### Upstream Branches

We also keep upstream branches for posterity. The following links point to the
interesting branches.

* [upstream tracking `2.5.x`](https://github.com/radiorabe/airtime/tree/2.5.x)
* [upstream archival `saas`](https://github.com/radiorabe/airtime/tree/saas)

## Developing

Please direct your Pull Requests to the existing feature branches if applicable.

To create a new feature branch you base it on the `2.5.x` branch. We will then
merge it into the `rabe` branch and add it to the README in the merge commit.

Any changes on the rabe branch get packaged by the [home:radiorabe:airtime obs project](https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/home:radiorabe:airtime) as soon as they have
been properly released.

## Releasing

1. Bump the version in the [specfile](airtime.spec) and in [constants.fork.php](airtime_mvc/application/configs/constants.fork.php)
   * Use `<airtime-ver>.<next-rabe-ver>` as the version number
   * Use `<next-rabe-ver>` in the `AIRTIME_FORK_VERSION` in the constants file
2. Add a commit with version bump related changes to rabe
   * write a commit message similiar to existing version commits
3. Tag the commit with the exact version
4. Push rabe and the tag to github
   * the tag and the branch need to stay in sync until a package is built
5. The openSUSE Build Service should get triggered and build a new package automagically
